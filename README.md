# REST-API
REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services
data is received from the Server or most commonly known as a Web-server. So, the client requests the server for the required information, via an API, and then, the server sends a response to the client. REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia.
